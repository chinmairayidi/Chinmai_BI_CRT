                                DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS
                               ------------------------------                          
DATA:- it is a raw fact which describes the attributes or properties of an entity.
STRUCTURE:- it is a structured format of arrangimg the data .
DATA STRUCTURES :- The process of organising the data .
CRUD:- C -creation /insertion   
       R -read/retrieve
       U - update/modify
       D - deletion/remove/
ALGORITHM:- it is a step by step procedure to execute a task.        
BIG-O NOTATION(O)-describes worst case scenario.
OMEGA NOTATION- DESCRIBES BEST CASE scenario.
THETA NOTATION- represents the average complecxity of an algorithm.
LINKED LIST:-SINGLY LINKED LIST--contains only one link which points to the subsequent pointern
             DOUBLY LINKED LIST--node points not only towards thr next pointer but also points to the previous 
             CIRCULARLY LINKED LIST--the last pointer points toward the first node
             DOUBLy CIRCULARLY LINKED LIST--head points tail &  tail points head


Operations on Linked List:
1)Traversing:✔ Follow the pointers
             ✔ Display the contents of the nodes as they were traversed.
             ✔ Stop when the next pointer points to None.

2)Printing :  Traversing the list from begining of the list(head) until we reach the None Pointer

3)Insertion : ✔ Before the Head of the begining
              ✔ After the Tail
              ✔ Middle of the List(Random Location)
              
4)Deletion : ✔ Deleting the First Node
             ✔ Deleting the an Intermediate Node
             ✔ Deleting the Last Node
