Object  Oriented Progrsming System(OOP'S)

Inheritence
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction



entity :- anythging which has existence

CLASS: it is collection of logical entity or blueprint or plan
        multiple objects created using same class is known as identical objects

OBJECTS:it is a real world physical entity 
        it is also known as instance

the class name can be any valid identifier
it can not be python reserved word 
a valid class ke name starts eith a letter followed by any number of letters,numbers and underscores
a class name generally starts with a CAPITAL letter

TO CREATE A CLASS:-
 we use class key word .
SYNTAX:
    object_name=class_name()
    object_name=class_name(arg)

types of constructor:
parameterised
non-parameterised
->Python supports special Type of Method called Constructor for initialising the Instance variable of a class
 ->A Constructor is only called once at the time of creating an Instance 
 ->If two Instances are created for a class,the Constructor will be called once for each Instance. 
 ->A class Constructor,if defined is called whenever a program creates an Object of that class.

PARAMETERIZED:
1)Parameterized Constructor: These are ones which have parameters(other than self) defined in the _ intit_ wethod's parameter Iit.
 -->This type of Constructor can take arguments from the user. 
2)Non-Parameterized Constructor:Also known as Default Constructor 
 -->The init method includes a single parameter self 
 -->NO other parameters are present init_ I'S parameter list 
 "->Consequently, this Constructor takes "no arguments" while creating a new object "
 ->Non-Parameterized Constructors assign Default values to the attributes of the class. I

__init__() method(magic method,dumdar method):
which is used to initialize the variables for the class
every class has __init__ and this is excutede with a  instantiate in the class 
you can also use this method to do anything you want to do when the object is created 
we do call this method explicity.

SELF :
self is a default variable that contains the memory adress of the current objects
this variable is used to refer all the  inatans variable and method.
when we create object of a class,the object name contains the memory location of the object  

OBJECTS have two different charecters:- 1.states --the properties or atributes of an object 
                                        represented --->DataMembers
                                        2.behaviours--the functionality or work done by the object
                                        represented--->functions/methods


w.a..p.p to create a mobile class and declare the states of mobile as colour,prize,brand,series,version,features,storage,battery capacity,processor create
10 objects and initialise using constructor print details of the individual objects ushong function.

type of methods:-
        ------>instance metho 
                        -accesor method 
                        -mutator method
        ------->class method
        ------->static methods

INSTANCE METHOD :-
-------------------
ACCESOR METHOD:- used to access or read and modify the data of the variable 
MUTATOR METHOD:-  used to access or read and modify the data of the variable
                also called as settor method 
                this method modify the data in the variables
                EG: def set_value(self)
                        def set_result(self)
                        def set_name(self)
                        def set_id(self)

write a py program to create a product class declare the states of the class as productname, productid, price,GST,mfdate,expdate
1) Create 5 objects initialize it using parameterized constructor and access them using instance method 
2) Declare mutator methods as set.objects given and change the values of their properties using mutators methods and print

w.a.p.p to a rectangle class and intialise the variable length and breadth using constructor and acess the values using mutator methods 

Destructors: The _del_ method is called Destructor.It is called when an object is about to be deleted.
Syntax ->
class Dog:
        def _del_(self):
                print(f"{self.name} is being destroyed.")
Class Methods  : Which Act upon the class variables or Static variable of the class.
                By Default,the first parameter of the class method is cls which refers to the class itself.
Static Methods : Used when some processing is related to the class but does not need the class or its Instances to perform any work
                We use this method when we want to pass some values from outside and perform some action in the method.
                Decorator @staticmethod need to write above the staticmethod.

Global Variable : A variable which is declared within the class but outside of a 
                  Method,Function,Constructor or Block is known as "GLOBAL VARIABLE".
                  Global Variable has global scope where you can access the variable throughout the Program.
                  It Has a Global Access.
Local Variable : A variable which is declared within the class but inside of a 
                  Method,Function,Constructor or Block is known as "LOCAL VARIABLE".
                  Local Variable has Limited scope where you can access the variable within the given scope(either function or method or Constructor)
                  It Has a Limited Access.

METHOD OVERLOADING:- within the same class having multiple methods  with same name but different parameters is
                     called method OVERLOADING
CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING:within the same class having multiple constructors with dsame name but different signatures 
                        is called condtructor overloading.                    
OPERATOR OVERLOADING:A Single Operator Performing Different Operations based on the datatype.


INHERITENCE: it is the proicess of aquiring the properties of one class into another class.
TYPES:- single , multilevel,multiple,hierarchial,hybrid
SUPER CLASS : the class which gives the property to another class is known as super class/base classs/parent class
SUB CLASS : The class which acquire the properties from another class is known  as sub class/ Derived class.
1)Single Level : Vehicle(Superclass)----->Car(Subclass)
2)Multiple Level: Vehicle(super class)--->Bike(Subclass)---->SuperBike(Subclass)
INTERMEDIATE CLASS : class which acts as subclass and superclass

POLYMORPHISM 
Performing a Single Task in multiple ways is called as "Polymorphism"
2 Types : 1)Compile time(Overloading)
          2)Run Time(Overriding)

Duck Typing : -> In python we follow a principle if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it
                must be a duck, which means python doesn't care about which class of object it is. If
                it is an object and requires behaviour is present for the object then it will work.
                The type of object is distinguished only at runtime this is called as DUCK TYPING.

Abstraction : It is a process of hiding the implementation and providing the Functionalities to the user
Interface : It is a Intermediate between Service and Consumer
Encapsulation : It is a Process of Wrapping up the states and Behaviours of an Entity for Data security
                and accessing it using Data Handler methods(Getter and Setter)
Inheritance : Acquiring properties from one class to another classb
